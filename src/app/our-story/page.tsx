              deliberate. The kind of thing you pick up, turn over, notice the texture of.
              The first batch was eight candles. They sold out in a weekend. The second batch was eight candles.
              We've kept it that way.`,

              can watch every pour, adjust the temperature, check the set. The soy wax is clean-burning.
              The cotton wicks are self-trimming. The botanicals — wax flowers, embedded petals,
              sculpted reliefs — are made separately and placed by hand while the wax is still warm.
              Burn time is honest: we test every mould before we sell it.`,

              The lotus petal rim is hand-crimped before the clay stiffens — that's why every bowl
              is slightly different. The glaze bleed on the blush bowls is pigment meeting a wet surface:
              controlled loosely, never exactly. The black lotus holder's gold edging is painted petal
              by petal with a fine brush. That's not a process you can photograph meaningfully —
